# The Polin Bot Clan
The polin bot clan is a series of bots run in the CLI of your computer. Download all files to use them. To use the bots you must have installed FIM.

**PLEASE NOTE: PBC CAN ONLY BE RUN ON A LINUX UBUNTU OS**

Info for people who aren't very good at tech:

FIM stands for FBI (frame buffer image) improved.

To install FIM (if not already), type this into your ubuntu terminal:
```bash
sudo apt install fim
```
Also,`this is also very important for people who aren't too good at tech`to make these files executable, type this into your command prompt:
```bash
ls -l
```
enter then:
```bash
chmod +x [filename with extension]
```
then do another 
```bash 
ls -l
```
and you will see the file go green and bold (or grold).
Then to run the file, type this:
```bash
bash [filename with extension]
```
*please note:* **[filename with extension]** is **not** what you are meant to type in obviously, type the file name with the extension.
